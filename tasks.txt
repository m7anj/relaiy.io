phase 1: auth                               (DONE)
- oauth setup with gmail integration setup
- store tokens in user model
- login system working (no frontend done yet)

how the OAuth flow works:
{
    1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
    2. App redirects user to Google with client_id, redirect_uri, and scope
    3. Google shows consent screen to the user
    4. User approves access on Google
    5. Google redirects user back to redirect_uri with an authorization code
    6. redirect_uri receives the code
    7. Server exchanges the code with Google for an access token (and user info)
    8. Server checks if user exists in the database
    9. Server creates the user if they do not exist
    10. Server creates a session and sets a session cookie
    11. Server redirects user to /
    12. / checks for the session cookie
    13. If session exists, render the app
    14. If session does not exist, redirect to /login
}

phase 2: worker architecture    (DONE)
- define worker types and enums
- define worker configuration

phase 3: worker functionality 
- endpoint that sends description to a llm model
- API calls for crud on a worker
- ui for input
